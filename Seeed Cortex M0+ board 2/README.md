# Seeeduino Cortex M0+ Board 2
This module consists of various of sensors for detecting gases. 

The board that read the sensors is [Seeed Cortex M0+](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Seeeduino-Cortex-M0/) with [Base Shield V2](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Base_Shield_V2/) to connect more sensors. 

In this board it consists of 8 sensors:
- [Grove VOC and eCO2 Gas Sensor (SGP41)](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/grove-smart-air-quality-sensor-sgp41/)
- [Grove Smart Air Quality Sensor (BME688)](https://www.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gas-Sensor-BME688-p-5478.html)
- [Grove MQ9 Gas Sensor](https://wiki.seeedstudio.com/Grove-Gas_Sensor-MQ9/)
- [Figaro TGS 2610]()
- [Figaro TGS 2611]()
- [Figaro TGS 2612](https://www.figarosensor.com/product/entry/tgs2612-D00.html)

The units collected are in Parts Per Million (ppm), Parts Per Billion (ppb), Percentage (%), Degree Celcius (Â°C), Voltage (V), Kilo Pascal (kPa), Kilo Ohms (kOhms).

These values in each unit will be compared and study when different gas is introduced.
